# JS_P1_Rock-Paper-Scissors

See The Project in Browser : https://casedo.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/ 

<s><p> I could not design properly frontpage. I had some issues with CSS layout. And unfortunately the program does not be seen properly on mobile as well because i had to use static position in the layout </p></s> [04/27/2018]<br>

New design is added. Still there is a problem with the mobile version but desktop looks better now ! 
I changed only html & css files. There is not any change in Javascript file. This was the first project that I created as a developer so this is why I thought that I should not improve it because it might be deceptive. When I looked back at this project after 3 months, I can easily realize that I really made good time :) [07/29/2018]
