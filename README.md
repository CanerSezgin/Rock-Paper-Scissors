# JS_P1_Rock-Paper-Scissors
<p> Learning JavaScript, this is the first project on a small scale. </p><hr>
<p> I tried to code by using less lines as far as possible. </p><hr>
<p> If you determine any error or if you have any advice, Please let me know. I pay attention so much to your opinion and suggestion.</p><hr>
<p> Thanks in advance. </p><hr>
